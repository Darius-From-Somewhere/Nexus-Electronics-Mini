<h1>History Of Nexus Corporation</h1>


<p1>In 1975, A man named Rudy 'Nexus' Carbine founded a company of the name Nexus. He had named it in that manner as he wanted to connect the world internationally
    with electronics. It started off as a simple company, before its own products range expanded into more practical electronics. In 2007, the company
    had decided to work on robotics as Mechanical Technology was growing. Fast forward to the modern day, it has managed to make
    several breakthroughs in robotics.
